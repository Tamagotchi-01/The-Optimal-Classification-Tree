# The-Optimal-Classification-Tree
          This research aims to develop a workflow for creating an optimal 
classification tree (OCT) model by using mixed-integer optimization (MIO), to 
evaluate the performance of the optimal classification tree model on German 
Credit dataset, and to extend the model to support datasets that contain 
explanatory variables with a lot of missing values. By developing the workflow, we 
found that creating an optimal classification tree by solving an MIO problem using 
Lin and Tang’s (2021) formulation, with the complexity parameter as a positive 
value close to zero, provides satisfactory results. By comparing the performance 
between the OCT and CART on German credit dataset, we found that both in
sample and out-of-sample accuracy of the OCT is greater than CART by 0.4 – 3.2%. 
One advantage of creating the OCT model by using MIO is the ability to extend the 
model to support additional required conditions. In this research, we propose an 
extension to the OCT model that supports datasets containing explanatory 
variables with a lot of missing values and show that the extended model can work 
effectively on the workflow.
